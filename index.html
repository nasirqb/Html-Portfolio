                    <h1>About Me</h1>
                    <p>My name is Nasir “Nells” Powell and I am a strong dedicated and open-minded person that is very eager to learn.  I am a person that live a lifestyle of Bhuddism.  It taught me to be discipline and stregthen my mind to remain focus.  Currently I am a UPS driver that delivers packages to and from customers.  But after enduring the delivery service for 18 years, I think it is time for me to move into a new path for the rest of my career.  I am a very driven person that once I get locked on something I see it through, recently I just purchased my first home in the middle of the pandemic.  I became the first person in my family to accomplish that goal.  I have always been a very focused person that likes to finish what I begin no matter how long it takes.  Because of this focus I will do anything in my power to get the job done and won’t be at ease until it's done. The thing that helps me with my focus is meditation.  I have been practicing Buddhism so I can get closer to my spiritual realm.   I’ve always been a driven and focused person that yearns for knowledge.  I do research on anything and everything I get myself into.  I need to understand all the aspects of the situation to better understand to get the job done.  For instance I took a mortgage course to understand how the mortgage process works.  Even though I am very computer savvy I'm no expert so in order to go into the field of programming I needed to know more than I already know about it.  This is the reason I am taking this course to get certified and educate myself to be a professional in the career move I want to make.  I am aiming to be  a software engineer in the future that can hopefully help switch positions within my current employer which is UPS.  But, one day land a job with the big name companies such as Amazon or Google</p>

                    <h1>Lifestyle</h1>
                    <p>I am a very active person.  In my spare time I like to do many things such as basketball, swimming, traveling is my favorite, going to movies just to name a few. My lifestyle has always been important to me growing up until I started practicing Buddhism.  This lifestyle in particular has given me some insights on life and how I live in this world that I never noticed before.  I was very unaware of how to live and the way I lived.  It made me more conscious of how I reacted to things.  Life is about reaction and energy so I would just react to how I felt at the moment and not worry about the consequences which will be the wrong decision down the road but felt right at the time.  I had to train my mind to process things first before I reacted.  This was also useful to take the software engineering class because I felt like I always had a little bit of ADHD and couldn't stay focused long enough on a specific topic or class before I got bored and moved on to something else.  I meditated everynight to prepare myself for the next day.  What ever I can't control I let go during mediation and it also help me with a goodnight rest.  I say that to say this buddhism has helped me make better and clearer decisions in my life to better my life.  So with every software engineering problem in and outside of this course I would make it my best effort to tackle the issue and assignment with the best of my ability.  </p>
