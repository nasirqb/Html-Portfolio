                    <h1>About Me</h1>
                    <p>My name is Nasir “Nells” Powell and I am a strong dedicated and open-minded person that is very eager to learn.  Currently I am a UPS driver that delivers packages to and from customers.  But after enduring the delivery service for 18 years, I think it is time for me to move into a new path for the rest of my career.  I am a very driven person that once I get locked on something I see it through, recently I just purchased my first home in the middle of the pandemic.  I became the first person in my family to accomplish that goal.  I have always been a very focused person that likes to finish what I begin no matter how long it takes.  Because of this focus I will do anything in my power to get the job done and won’t be at ease until it's done. The thing that helps me with my focus is meditation.  I have been practicing Buddhism so I can get closer to my spiritual realm.   I’ve always been a driven and focused person that yearns for knowledge.  I do research on anything and everything I get myself into.  I need to understand all the aspects of the situation to better understand to get the job done.  For instance I took a mortgage course to understand how the mortgage process works.  Even though I am very computer savvy I'm no expert so in order to go into the field of programming I needed to know more than I already know about it.  This is the reason I am taking this course to get certified and educate myself to be a professional in the career move I want to make.  I am aiming to be  a software engineer in the future that can hopefully help switch positions within my current employer which is UPS.  But, one day land a job with the big name companies such as Amazon or Google</p>
